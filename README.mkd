# Command line tool for inotify

## Dependencies

 * [argparse](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse)

## Usage

See `react --help`

### Hello World
`react.py /tmp -i '*.txt' 'echo {}'`

This is a simple test. Execute the above command and create and modify
directories and files in /tmp. For every file ending with .txt its full path is
printed on the console every time this file is created or changed.

### Executing test suites
`react.py ../ -i '*.hs' ./runTests`

The main motivation of this tool was to be able to trigger the execution of a
test suite each time a source file of the project is modified. This speeds up
my vim-based software development a lot.

### Setting file ACL entries
`react.py /srv/www/team 'setfacl -m g:team:rwx {}'`

A major disadvantage of default [file ACLs](http://linux.die.net/man/1/setfacl)
is that it only reacts on newly created files. If you move a file into a
directory with a default ACL entry, this file's ACL entries are not updated. In
practice this means that sooner or later every default-ACL-based control
management will break. With react you can circumvent this problem.
